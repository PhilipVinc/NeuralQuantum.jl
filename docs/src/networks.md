### Neural Quantum State
This is an implementation of a Neural Quantum State, a simple RBM state as proposed by [Carleo et Troyer Science 2018](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602).
Please note that you can chose the activation function (the third argument, `f`) to be either a softplus function `af_softplus` or a logcosh function `af_logcosh`. The best performance is found by combining logcosh with a spin-like hilbert space.

## Mixed State Networks
In general, given an Hilbert space ``\mathcal{H}`` with basis ``\vec\sigma\in\mathcal{H}``, a density matrix defined on this space lives in the space of the Bounded Operators ``\mathcal{B}`` with (overcomplete) basis ``(\sigma, \tilde{\sigma} ) \in \mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}``.  A network is a (high-dimensional non-linear) function

```math
\rho(\sigma, \tilde\sigma, W)
```
depending on the variational parameters ``W``, and on the entries of the density matrix labelled by ``(\sigma, \tilde\sigma)``.

### Neural Density Matrix
[Torlai et Melko PRL 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09684)

A real-valued neural network to describe a positive-semidefinite matrix. Complex numbers are generated by duplicating the structure of the network, and using one to generate the modulus and the other to generate the phase. See the article for details.

### RBM Density Matrix
A simple state that does not preserve positivity, but which is hermitian.
